🚀 GPT From Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a mini GPT-like text generator from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.
It guides you through every step — from preparing data to training a model, saving it, and generating new text.

📂 Project Overview

Notebook (ChatGPT_From_Scratch.ipynb) – the main code for training and experimenting.

Dataset (data.txt) – text data used for training the model.

Tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl) – saved tokenizer for text preprocessing.

Trained Model (gpt_model/ or .keras/.h5) – the final trained GPT-like model.

This makes it easy to reproduce results, fine-tune, or extend the project.

🔧 Requirements

You need:

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow 2.x

NumPy

(Optional) Matplotlib for visualizations

The project is best run in Google Colab for GPU acceleration.

📝 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Start with a text dataset (e.g., data.txt).

The dataset is tokenized and converted into sequences that the model can understand.

2️⃣ Model Training

A GPT-inspired model architecture is built using Keras Sequential API.

The model is trained on the tokenized data for multiple epochs.

Training logs show accuracy and validation accuracy improvements.

3️⃣ Saving the Model & Tokenizer

Once trained, the model is saved for later use.

The tokenizer (responsible for text-to-sequence conversion) is also saved.

This ensures you don’t need to retrain every time.

4️⃣ Generating Text

Using the trained model and tokenizer, new text sequences can be generated.

You start with a seed sentence, and the model predicts the next words step by step.

5️⃣ Packaging the Project

All files (notebook, model, tokenizer, dataset) are organized into a single folder.

The folder can be zipped and uploaded to GitHub or shared via Google Drive.

📊 Example Results

The model gradually improves its accuracy with training epochs.

Generated text starts as random words but becomes more coherent as the training progresses.

Validation accuracy indicates how well the model generalizes.

🌟 Future Improvements

Add attention layers for better context handling.

Train on larger and more diverse datasets.

Implement a full Transformer-based architecture.

Deploy the trained model with a web app (Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit).
